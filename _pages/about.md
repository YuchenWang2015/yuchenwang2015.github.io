I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/) working with [Professor Norah Hoffmann](https://www.hoffmanngroup.info/). I hold a Bachelor's Degree from Anhui Normal University in Chemistry, and an Chemistry Ph.D. from Kansas State University with [Professor Christine Aikens](https://www.k-state.edu/chem/about/people/faculty/aikens/).

My previous research mainly focused on xxx.
